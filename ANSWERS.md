## A - The entities

I decided to model this with four entities (and four tables).
An Engine entity for ENGINE nodes in the XML file, that contains information about the Car's engines. It has power and type.
A Wheel entity for WHEELS nodes in the XML file, that contains information about the car's wheels. 
A  SubModel entity for SUBMODELS nodes in the XML file, that contains information about different submodels for a car's model, 
and an entity called Model for the MODEL nodes in the XML file, that contains all the information a car's Model can have.

For more information about entities and database tables, take a look at the UML and ERM diagrams added.
